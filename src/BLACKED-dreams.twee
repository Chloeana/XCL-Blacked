  [As Jack pulls out, Isabelle slides down to her knees, eyes fixed on him as she leans forward, waiting for his load. (nl:1) 
  You watch her intently, each slow, deliberate movement sparking a mix of envy and thrill inside you.(nl:2)
  The way she waits—poised, ready—sends a shiver through you, her heartbeat mirroring your own as she prepares for what's to come. (nl:1)
  Her recent orgasm has only deepened her desire, her chest rising and falling with anticipation, and it’s harder to ignore the ache building within you, making your mouth water with jealousy.(nl:2)

      Then, with a grunt, Jack releases, several thick streams coating Isabelle's face. The first warm strand drips down her cheek, pooling at her chin before spilling down her collarbone, marking her breasts.(nl:1) 
      She catches some on her tongue with a satisfied hum, then carelessly spits a bit onto her chest, smearing it across her skin. (nl:2)
